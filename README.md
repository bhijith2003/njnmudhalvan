Earthquake Data Analysis with Artificial Neural Networks

This script is used for cleaning and preparing earthquake data for analysis using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

Dependencies:

Pandas: Data manipulation library
NumPy: Numerical computing library
Matplotlib: Data visualization library
Seaborn: Data visualization library
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library
TensorFlow: Deep learning framework for building ANNs
Keras: High-level neural networks API that works with TensorFlow -pytorch: known for its dynamic computational graph and user-friendly, Pythonic design, popular in research and development. Installation: You can install the required dependencies using pip. Here we run every code in google compiler so we just need to import the package.If it shows the error install the package by pip install
First: Do the data cleaning which will be explained in the phase 2

Second: Do the data visualization which will be done in phase 3

Third: Seperate the dataset into four parts and we explained that in phase 4

Finally: We will train the model and check the accuracy score which will explained in document phase 5
